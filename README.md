# Covid-19-Analysis-using-Python
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization of statewise Covid-19 data in India. The analysis covers the spread of Covid-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and other related metrics across the nation. By utilizing Python libraries and geojson for map plotting, the project provides a detailed geographical representation of statewise Covid-19 data, allowing for better understanding and insights.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset was cleaned by renaming columns, handling missing or null values, and eliminating duplicates. New columns were created for improved analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive analysis was conducted to identify trends in Covid-19 cases, death rates, and recovery patterns across Indian states. This included data visualizations to better interpret the spread and impact of the virus.

Geospatial Visualization: Used geojson to create interactive maps that visualize statewise Covid-19 data, allowing users to quickly compare and understand the spread across different regions.

Excel Dashboard: Findings from the analysis were converted into an interactive Excel dashboard, summarizing key insights in a user-friendly format.
